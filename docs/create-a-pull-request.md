# Create a pull request

- Try to keep the pull requests small. A pull request should try its very best to address only a single concern.
- For work in progress pull requests, please use the Draft PR feature.
- Make sure all tests pass and add additional tests for the code you submit. More info here.
- Document your reasoning behind the changes. Explain why you wrote the code in the way you did. The code should explain what it does.
- If there's an existing issue, reference to it by adding something like References/Closes/Fixes/Resolves #123, where 123 is the issue number. More info here.
- Please fill out the PR Template when making a PR.
- All commits in a pull request will be squashed when merged.
- Please note: a core team member may close your PR if it has gone stale or if we don't plan to merge the code.
